This project is no longer under development. I have since found a handful of very useful tools which accomplish the same as I was attempting to make available here -- and in much better form, I might add.

If you've stumbled upon this page because you have an interest in Eve online and, more specifically, it's market, check out these tools:

- `Evernus <http://evernus.com/>`_
- `NEAT <http://pwning.de/neat/index.php>`_

An Inventory Management Application for use with the game `EVE Online <http://www.eveonline.com/>`_

`Docs <http://eve-online-inventory-manager.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

Note: This application is not ready for public consumption; I wouldn't even try...

Using:

* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
* `EVELink <https://github.com/eve-val/evelink>`_
